A brand new ebook of inspiring [testing stories](https://leanpub.com/testing_stories/). Software testing professionals from around the globe have volunteered to each share a story related to software testing, with the aim of inspiring others from their experiences.

The initiative was kick started by [Melissa Fisher](https://twitter.com/fishoutthebox) in the original post [Testing Stories EBook](https://fishoutthebox.medium.com/testing-stories-ebook-a389ffd6b54b).  I decided to contribute my side of story in book also by sharing how **Technical knowledge leads to productive testing**. It has been an absolutely great experience working with so many great minds and collaborating on this book.

The team have decided to donate all royalties sold through leanpub to [Open Sourcing Mental Illness](https://osmihelp.org/) (OSMI), as we collectively value their mission statement and work in mental health in the tech and open source communities.

You can read my story and others's inspiring stories and support for a great cause.
