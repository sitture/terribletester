A computer science graduate from University of Leeds.  I've been working as a Test Engineer after graduating in 2012 and currently a Software Test Engineer at [Sky@LeedsDock](https://www.leedsdock.com/whos-here/sky/) for almost 5 years.  

My career in Testing started with an industrial placement at Vodafone HQ in Newbury and I've never looked back since.  A lot of the developers have to consider testing as part of their development career.  And I see myself as a Technical Tester who is able to work closely with the devleopers and offer testing guidance.

I have a great interest in playground of various testing tools that could be used for aiding in testing.  A `TestOps` kid who imensely enjoys setting up new projects as part of Continuous Integration pipelines and a keen interest in early environments setup.  I highly believe in the following moto:

> Test Automation isn't a replacement but an aid to gain confidence in quality.

I'm really enjoying the shift in micro-services/containerisation using `docker` and `kubernetes` and I'll be using the blog to share my experiences of using these and various tools which could hopefully help other likeminded testers.
